## Dependencies and virtual environments

Dependencies and virtual environments are managed by [Poetry](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry).

You don't have to -and you should not- create the virtualenvs yourself,
or activate/deactivate them.

Use `poetry install` to create the virtualenv the first time and install the dependencies.
Re-run `poetry install` to re-install the dependencies into the virtualenv.

Dependencies are written in `pyproject.toml`,
under the `[tool.poetry.dependencies]` or `[tool.poetry.dev-dependencies]` sections.
Example:

```toml
[tool.poetry.dependencies]
python = "^3.6"
fastapi = "<1.0"
importlib-metadata = "^2.0.0"
```

You can write them there manually, or use the commands provided by Poetry:

```bash
poetry add numpy  # add as a production dependency
poetry add -D numpy  # or add as a development dependency

# the "remove" equivalent
poetry remove numpy
poetry remove -D numpy
```

- Use `poetry update` the re-lock the dependencies
  (write the complete dependency resolution in `poetry.lock`)
  and install their updated version in the virtualenv.
- Use `poetry lock` to just re-lock the dependencies.
- Use `poetry run CMD [ARGS...]` to run a command in the virtualenv.
- Use `poetry shell` to activate/enter the virtualenv,
  and `exit` to deactivate/exit the virtualenv.
- Use `poetry show` to show the list of dependencies.

See `poetry COMMAND --help` for details about each command.

## Tasks

The tasks are written in Python (for cross-platform compatibility),
and based on the task-runner called [duty](https://github.com/pawamoy/duty).
They are written in the `duties.py` file,
and decorated with the `@duty` decorator.

Example:

```python
@duty
def check_docs(ctx):
    """Check if the documentation builds correctly."""
    ctx.run("mkdocs build -s", title="Building documentation")
```

To run a task, use `poetry run duty TASK [ARG=VALUE...]`.
You can run multiple tasks at once: `poetry run duty TASK1 ARG=VALUE TASK2`.
You can list the available tasks with `poetry run duty --list`.

Available tasks:

- `changelog`: Update the changelog in-place with latest commits.
  See [the Changelog section](#changelog).
- `check`: Check it all!
  See [the Quality Analysis section](#quality-analysis).
- `check-code-quality`: Check the code quality.
  See [the check-code-quality section](#check-code-quality).
- `check-dependencies`: Check for vulnerabilities in dependencies.
  See [the check-dependencies section](#check-dependencies).
- `check-docs`: Check if the documentation builds correctly.
  See [the check-docs section](#check-docs).
- `check-types`: Check that the code is correctly typed.
  See [the check-types section](#check-types).
- `clean`: Delete temporary files.
- `coverage`: Report coverage as text and HTML.
- `docs`: Build the documentation locally.
  See [the Documentation section](#documentation).
- `docs-serve`: Serve the documentation (localhost:8000). Arguments:
    - `host="127.0.0.1"`: The host to serve the docs from.
    - `port=8000`: The port to serve the docs on.
- `format`: Run formatting tools on the code.
- `release`: Release a new Python package.
  See [the Releases section](#releases).
  Arguments:
    - `version` The Python package version.
- `test`: Run the test suite. 
  See [the Tests section](#tests).
  Arguments:
    - `match=""`: A pytest expression to filter selected tests.

### Makefile

A Makefile is available for convenience. It's just a shortcut to run duties.

Available rules are the same, with two additional rules: `help` and `setup`.

- `changelog`
- `check`
- `check-code-quality`
- `check-dependencies`
- `check-docs`
- `check-types`
- `clean`
- `coverage`
- `docs`
- `docs-serve`
- `format`
- `release`
- `setup`
- `test`

The default rule is `help`, so running `make` will show the available rules.
The `setup` rule is explained below.

## Workflow

The first thing you should run when entering your repository is:

```bash
make setup
```

This will install the project's dependencies in new Python virtualenvs:
one virtualenv per chosen Python version.
The chosen Python versions are defined
in both scripts `setup.sh` and `multirun.sh`
in the `scripts/` folder.
You can change them here permanently,
or temporarily with the `PYTHON_VERSIONS` environment variable.

If you don't have the `make` command,
you can use `bash scripts/setup.sh` instead,
or even just `poetry install`
if you don't plan on using multiple Python versions.

Now you can start writing and editing code in `src/your_package`.

- You can auto-format the code with `make format`.
- You can run a quality analysis with `make check`.
- Once you wrote tests for your new code,
  you can run the test suite with `make test`.
- Once you are ready to publish a new release,
  run `make changelog`, then `make release version=x.y.z`,
  where `x.y.z` is the version added to the changelog.

To summarize, the typical workflow is:

```bash
make setup  # only once

<write code>
make format  # to auto-format the code

<write tests>
make test  # to run the test suite

make check  # to check if everything is OK

<commit your changes>

make changelog  # to update the changelog
<edit changelog if needed>

make release version=x.y.z
```

Remember that `make` is just a shortcut for `poetry run duty` here.

## Quality analysis

The quality checks are started with:

```
make check
```

This action is actually a composition of several checks:

- `check-code-quality`: Check the code quality.
- `check-dependencies`: Check for vulnerabilities in dependencies.
- `check-docs`: Check if the documentation builds correctly.
- `check-types`: Check if the code is correctly typed.

For example, if you are only interested in checking types,
run `make check-types`.

### check-code-quality

The code quality analysis is done
with [Flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/),
and a battery of Flake8 plugins.
The analysis is configured in `config/flake8.ini`.
In this file, you can deactivate rules
or activate others to customize your analysis.
Rules identifiers always start with one or more capital letters,
like `D`, `S` or `BLK`, then followed by a number.
You can ignore a rule on a specific code line by appending
a `noqa` comment ("no quality analysis/assurance"):

```python
print("a code line that triggers a flake8 warning")  # noqa: ID
```

...where ID is the identifier of the rule you want to ignore for this line.

Example:

```python
# src/your_package/module.py
import subprocess
```

```console
$ make check-code-quality
✗ Checking code quality (1)
  > flake8 --config=config/flake8.ini src/ tests/ scripts/
  src/your_package/module.py:2:1: S404 Consider possible security implications associated with subprocess module.
```

Now add a comment to ignore this warning.
As a best-practice, and because rules identifiers
are not self-explanatory, add a comment explaining
why we ignore the warning:

```python
# module.py
import subprocess  # noqa: S404 (we don't mind the security implications)
```

```console
$ make check-code-quality
✓ Checking code quality
```

You can disable multiple different warnings on a single line
by separating them with commas:

```python
markdown_docstring = """
    Look at this docstring:

    ```python
    \"\"\"
    print("code block")
    \"\"\"
    ```
"""  # noqa: D300,D301 (escape sequences: it's not a regex)
```

You can disable a warning globally by adding its ID
into the list in `config/flake8.ini`.

You can also disable warnings per file, like so:

```ini
; in config/flake8.ini
per-file-ignores =
    ; module imported but unused
    src/your_package/__init__.py:F401
    ; continuation line under-indented for hanging indent
    setup.py:E121
    ; mutable constant
    src/your_package/your_module.py:WPS407
```

### check-dependencies

This action uses the tool [`safety`](https://github.com/pyupio/safety)
to check if the **production** dependencies used in the project
are subject to CVEs by querying an online database.

An example of full report looks like the following:

```
+==============================================================================+
| REPORT                                                                       |
+============================+===========+==========================+==========+
| package                    | installed | affected                 | ID       |
+============================+===========+==========================+==========+
| django                     | 1.2       | <1.2.2                   | 25701    |
+==============================================================================+
| Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Django 1.2.x before 1.2.2 allows |
|  remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via a csrfmiddlewar |
| etoken (aka csrf_token) cookie.                                              |
+==============================================================================+
```

### check-docs

This action builds the documentation with strict behavior:
any warning will be considered an error and the command will fail.

The warnings/errors can be about incorrect docstring format,
or invalid cross-references.

See the [Documentation section](#documentation) for more information.

### check-types

This action runs [`mypy`](http://mypy-lang.org/) on the source code
to find potential typing errors.

## Tests

Run the test suite with:

```
make test
```

Behind the scenes, it uses [`pytest`](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/)
and plugins to collect and run the tests, and output a report.

Code source coverage is computed thanks to
[coveragepy](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/coverage-5.1/).

Sometimes you don't want to run the whole test suite,
but rather one particular test, or group of tests.
Pytest provides a `-k` option to allow filtering the tests.
The Makefile `test` rule therefore accept a `match=` argument
to specify the value of Pytest's `-k` option:

```
make test match=training
make test match="app and route2"
```

Example of output:

```

## Continuous Integration

The quality checks and tests are executed in parallel
in a [GitHub Workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@2.22/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions)
or in [GitLab CI](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/).

For GitHub, the CI is configured in `.github/ci/workflow.yml`,
and for GitLab it's configured in `.gitlab-ci.yml`.

To force a step to pass even when it fails,
add `nofail=CI` or `nofail=True` to the corresponding
`ctx.run` instruction in `duties.py`

## Changelog

Changelogs are absolutely useful when your software
is updated regularly, to inform your users about the new features
that were added or the bugs that were fixed.

But writing a changelog manually is a cumbersome process.

This is why we offer, with this template,
a way to automatically update the changelog.
There is one requirement though for it to work:
you must use the
[Angular commit message convention](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit).

For a quick reference:

```
<type>[(scope)]: Subject

[Body]
```

Scope and body are optional. Type can be:

- `build`: About packaging, building wheels, etc.
- `chore`: About packaging or repo/files management.
- `ci`: About Continuous Integration.
- `docs`: About documentation.
- `feat`: New feature.
- `fix`: Bug fix.
- `perf`: About performance.
- `refactor`: Changes which are not features nor bug fixes.
- `style`: A change in code style/format.
- `tests`: About tests.

The two most important are `feat` and `fix` types.
For other types of commits, you can do as you like.

Subject (and body) must be valid Markdown.
If you write a body, please add issues references at the end:

```
Body.

References: #10, #11.
Fixes #15.
```

Examples:

```
feat: Add training route
```

```
fix: Stop deleting user data
```

Following that convention will allow to generate
new entries in the changelog while following the rules
of [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).

Once you are ready to publish a new release of your package,
run the following command:

```
make changelog
```

This will update the changelog in-place, using the latest,
unpublished-yet commits.

If this group of commits contains only bug fixes (`fix:`)
and/or commits that are not interesting for users (`chore:`, `style:`, etc.),
the changelog will gain a new **patch** entry.
It means that the new suggested version will be a patch bump
of the previous one: `0.1.1` becomes `0.1.2`.

If this group of commits contains at least one feature (`feat:`),
the changelog will gain a new **minor** entry.
It means that the new suggested version will be a minor bump
of the previous one: `0.1.1` becomes `0.2.0`.

If there is, in this group, a commit whose body contains
something like `Breaking change`,
the changelog will gain a new **major** entry,
unless the version is still an "alpha" version
(starting with 0), in which case it gains a **minor** entry.
It means that the new suggested version will be a major bump
of the previous one: `1.2.1` becomes `2.0.0`,
but `0.2.1` is only bumped up to `0.3.0`.
Moving from "alpha" status to "beta" or "stable" status
is a choice left to the developers,
when they consider the package is ready for it.

Finally, once your changelog has been updated,
make sure its contents are correct (add, remove or edit anything
you need), and use the new version (the one that was added
into the changelog) to create a new release:

```
make release version=x.y.z
```

...where x.y.z is the version added in the changelog.

## Releases

As seen in the previous section, you can use the `release` rule
of the Makefile to publish new versions of the Python package.

Usually, just before running `make release version=x.y.z`,
you run `make changelog` to update the changelog and
use the newly added version as the argument to `make release`.

For example, if after running `make changelog`, the diff
shows a new `0.5.1` entry in the changelog, you must
release this exact same version with `make release version=0.5.1`.

The `release` action does several things, in this order:

- Update the version in `pyproject.toml`
- Stage the modified files (`pyproject.toml` and `CHANGELOG.md `)
- Commit the changes with a message like `chore: Prepare release 0.5.1`
- Tag the commit with that version
- Push the commits
- Push the tags
- Build the package dist and wheel
- Publish the dist and wheel to PyPI.org

## Documentation

The documentation is built with [Mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/),
the [Material for Mkdocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) theme,
and the [mkdocstrings](https://github.com/pawamoy/mkdocstrings) plugin.

### Writing

The pages are written in Markdown, and thanks to `mkdocstrings`,
even your Python docstrings can be written in Markdown.
`mkdocstrings` particularly supports the
[Google-style](https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html)
for docstrings.

The documentation configuration is written into `mkdocs.yml`,
at the root of the project. The Markdown pages are written
in the `docs/` directory. You can use any level of nesting you want.
The left-sidebar navigation is configured through the `nav` key
in `mkdocs.yml`.

For example, with these docs structure:

```
📁 docs
├── 📄 changelog.md
├── 📄 index.md
└── 📁 reference
    ├── 📄 cli.md
    └── 📄 logic.md
```

...you can have these navigation items in `mkdocs.yml`:

```yaml
nav:
- Overview: index.md
- Code Reference:
  - cli.py: reference/cli.md
  - logic.py: reference/logic.md
- Changelog: changelog.md
```

Note that we matched the sections in the navigation with the folder tree,
but that is not mandatory.

`mkdocstrings` allows you to inject documentation of Python objects
in Markdown pages with the following syntax:

```md
::: path.to.object
    OPTIONS
```

...where `OPTIONS` is a YAML block containing configuration options
for both the selection of Python objects and their rendering.

You can document an entire module or even package with a single instruction:

```md
::: your_package
```

...but it's usually better to have each module injected in a separate page.

For more information about `mkdocstrings`,
check [its documentation](https://pawamoy.github.io/mkdocstrings).

### Serving

MkDocs provides a development server with files watching and live-reload.
Run `make docs-serve` to serve your documentation on `localhost:8000`.

If you run it in a remote host (Linux VM) and would like to access it
from your local browser, bind the server to 0.0.0.0 instead:

```bash
make docs-serve host=0.0.0.0
```

If needed, you can also change the port used:

```bash
make docs-serve host=0.0.0.0 port=5000
```

### Deploying

MkDocs has a `gh-deploy` command that will deploy
you documentation on GitHub pages.
We make use of this command in the `docs-deploy` action:

```bash
make docs-deploy
```

If you'd prefer to deploy on ReadTheDocs instead,
you will likely have to write
a `readthedocs.yml` configuration file
and enable the project on ReadTheDocs.
